Hello, I'm Jan Wehner a PhD student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information](https://cispa.de/en) working on AI Safety. I believe AI has enoromous potential but also poses grave risks that need to be addressed urgently. Thus I research methods for improving the safety of frontier AI systems. I am especially interested in developing methods to understand, monitor and control the behavior of LLMs. I've done research on [Representation Engineering](/publications/2025-02-27-paper-title-number-6), [Harmful fine-tuning attacks](/publications/2025-02-06-paper-title-number-5) and [Inverse Reinforcement Learning](/publications/2024-12-16-paper-title-number-4).

My PhD is supervised by [Prof. Mario Fritz](https://cispa.de/en/people/mario.fritz). As part of the [ELLIS PhD Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) I am co-supervised by [Prof. David Krueger](https://davidscottkrueger.com/) at MILA. I've previously obtained my master's degree at TU Delft and a bachelor's degree at Otto-Friedrich-University Bamberg.

Please don't hesitate to reach out ot me at [jan.wehner@cispa.de](jan.wehner@cispa.de)!
